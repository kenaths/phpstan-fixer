## Post-Publishing Tasks

### 1. Test Installation
```bash
# Create a test project
mkdir test-phpstan-fixer
cd test-phpstan-fixer
composer init --no-interaction

# Install your package
composer require --dev YOUR_VENDOR/phpstan-fixer

# Test the binary
vendor/bin/phpstan-fix --help
```

### 2. Announce the Release
- Write a blog post or article
- Share on Twitter/X with #PHP #PHPStan tags
- Post in relevant PHP communities (Reddit r/PHP, PHP Discord, etc.)
- Submit to PHP Weekly newsletter

### 3. Monitor and Maintain
- Watch for issues on GitHub
- Respond to user feedback
- Plan future releases
- Keep dependencies updated

## Version Management

Follow Semantic Versioning:
- MAJOR version: Breaking changes
- MINOR version: New features (backward compatible)
- PATCH version: Bug fixes

Example:
- 1.0.0 â†’ 1.0.1 (bug fix)
- 1.0.1 â†’ 1.1.0 (new fixer added)
- 1.1.0 â†’ 2.0.0 (breaking API change)

## Continuous Integration (Optional but Recommended)

Create `.github/workflows/tests.yml`:

```yaml
name: Tests

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        php-version: ['8.2', '8.3', '8.4']
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
    - name: Setup PHP
      uses: shivammathur/setup-php@v2
      with:
        php-version: ${{ matrix.php-version }}
        coverage: none
    
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: composer install --prefer-dist --no-progress
    
    - name: Run tests
      run: composer test
    
    - name: Run PHPStan
      run: vendor/bin/phpstan analyse src --level=5
```

## Important Notes

1. **Vendor Name**: Replace `YOUR_VENDOR` with your actual vendor name (usually your username or organization name)
2. **Package Name**: The package name should be lowercase and use hyphens (not underscores)
3. **Stability**: Mark as stable only when thoroughly tested
4. **Security**: Never commit sensitive information (passwords, API keys)
5. **Licensing**: Ensure all code is properly licensed

## Troubleshooting

### Package Not Found After Publishing
- Wait 1-2 minutes for Packagist to process
- Check if the repository is public
- Verify composer.json is valid JSON

### Webhook Not Working
- Ensure the webhook URL is correct
- Check GitHub webhook delivery history
- Verify Packagist API token if using authentication

## Success Metrics

Track your package success:
- Downloads on Packagist
- GitHub stars and forks
- Issues and pull requests
- Community feedback

Good luck with your package release! ðŸš€
